## Deep-Learning-Reinforcement-Learning-Strategy-Design

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates two complementary areas of AI research:  
1. **Image-Based Deep Learning Pipeline**  
   - Attempted GAN-based image generation using DCGAN on MS COCO subset.  
   - Due to poor output quality, fallback strategy was adopted using 5 real images.  
   - Implemented **object detection** with YOLOv8n and **image captioning** with BLIP-base.  

2. **Reinforcement Learning Strategy Design**  
   - Designed a conceptual Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for the **classic Pong game**.  
   - Defined states, actions, and rewards.  
   - Outlined training techniques: experience replay, target networks, epsilon-greedy exploration, and reward discounting.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results
- GAN struggled to generate realistic images â†’ fallback strategy improved results.  
- YOLOv8n: effective detection but occasional misclassifications.  
- BLIP-base: robust captions even when detection failed.  
- Pong RL agent design provided a solid foundation for future implementation.

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Implement Pong RL agent training and evaluation.  
- Explore advanced GANs (StyleGAN, diffusion models).  
- Fine-tune captioning/detection models for better domain alignment.
